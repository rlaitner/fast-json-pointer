Fast JSON Pointer
=================

.. inclusion-marker-do-not-remove

.. _RFC 6901: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6901
.. _relative JSON pointer: https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/relative-json-pointer

Implements `RFC 6901`_ JSON pointers, and `relative JSON pointer`_ resolution.

This module is not necissarily fast (yet), but there are enough variations on
``json-pointer`` in pypi to merit picking some prefix to differentiate, and "fast"
seemed a relatively short and punchy choice.

If you need this to *really* be fast, open an issue and let me know. I want to do
a rust extension module at some point. That ought to be fast enough to claim we're
fast.
